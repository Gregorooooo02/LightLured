# LightLured
Horror game made for my Engineer Thesis - Elements of Diegetic Connectivity in Shaping Satisfaction in Video Game Design.

## Story
After the main character comes back to his house, he got a phone call from his wife, where she tells him, she will be back in a few days, but something horrible happened, and now our protagonist needs to help his wife. Wander around the cabin and found out how the curse of the forest can be broken.

## Mechanics
Light is your ally, but also your enemy. With a lantern equipped, the player can see where are the collectibles in the forest, but it also lure the monsters to the player, so be careful!

## Tasks
The goal is to collect all the 5 books. Must be easy, right?
